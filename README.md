# Tweets predict Missing & Found People in California Campfire
The CampFire was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history, and the most expensive natural disaster in the world in 2018 in terms of insured losses. Most people died due to the tremendous fire, and over 10,000 houses were burned. Some technologies could be used for human-being to better find the useful information they need. In this project, what we want to do is to access related tweets of 2018 California wildfire by using Hydrator, and see whether the social media like Twitter cooperated with nowadaysâ€™ technology could be a helpful tool, positively affecting rescue process.
